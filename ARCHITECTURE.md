# üéÆ Gaming Platform Architecture Plan

## Current State Analysis

### ‚úÖ What We Have
- **Frontend**: Rust WASM + HTMX + Vite hot reload
- **Deployment**: Railway with Docker
- **Architecture**: Static frontend with minimal JS glue
- **Working**: Beautiful UI, Rust functions callable from browser

### üéØ Vision
A web-native gaming platform with built-in streaming where:
- Players interact in real-time games
- Spectators watch live gameplay  
- Voice/video chat between players
- No external streaming services needed

## Technical Challenges to Solve

### 1. **Transport Protocol Decision**
**Options:**
- WebSockets (current standard, universal support)
- WebTransport (cutting edge, lower latency, better for gaming)

**WebTransport Concerns:**
- Browser support: Chrome ‚úÖ, Firefox üöß, Safari ‚ùì
- Production readiness of `wtransport` crate
- TLS certificate complexity for local dev
- Railway deployment compatibility

**Decision:** Going with WebTransport first for maximum performance!

### 2. **Real-time Architecture**
**Game Data Flow:**
```
Player Input ‚Üí Frontend WASM ‚Üí Transport ‚Üí Server ‚Üí Other Players
                   ‚Üì
              Local Prediction ‚Üê Server Authoritative State
```

**Spectating Flow:**
```
Game Server ‚Üí Broadcast ‚Üí Multiple Spectator Clients
     ‚Üì
Voice/Video P2P between Players ‚Üí Spectators (WebRTC)
```

### 3. **State Management**
- **Client**: WASM game state + DOM updates via HTMX
- **Server**: Authoritative game state + conflict resolution
- **Spectators**: Read-only game state + chat participation

### 4. **Deployment Strategy**
- **Frontend**: Railway (current setup working)
- **Game Server**: Railway (new deployment)
- **Communication**: HTTPS/WSS between services
- **Certificates**: Let's Encrypt for production

## Phased Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation (WebTransport)
**Goal:** Get basic real-time communication working with cutting-edge transport

1. **WebTransport Server**
   - Echo server for testing with wtransport crate
   - Connection management with HTTP/3
   - TLS certificate setup for development
   - Deploy to Railway

2. **Frontend WebTransport Client**
   - Connect from WASM to server using WebTransport API
   - Send/receive binary messages for low latency
   - Integrate with existing HTMX UI
   - Graceful fallback detection

3. **Basic Game Loop**
   - Player position updates via WebTransport streams
   - Server broadcasts to all clients
   - Simple 2D movement demo with minimal latency

### Phase 2: Game Features
**Goal:** Actual gameplay mechanics

1. **Game State Management**
   - Player entities
   - Game world/rooms
   - Event system

2. **Input Handling**
   - Keyboard/mouse input in WASM
   - Input validation on server
   - Lag compensation

3. **Simple Game**
   - 2D movement
   - Player interactions
   - Score/stats

### Phase 3: Spectating
**Goal:** Real-time spectator experience

1. **Spectator Mode**
   - Read-only game state streaming
   - Spectator UI in HTMX
   - Player count display

2. **Live Chat**
   - Spectator chat system
   - Player-spectator interaction
   - Moderation features

### Phase 4: Voice/Video (WebRTC)
**Goal:** Audio/video communication

1. **WebRTC Signaling**
   - SDP offer/answer exchange
   - ICE candidate sharing
   - Connection establishment

2. **Voice Chat**
   - Player-to-player voice
   - Push-to-talk controls
   - Audio quality controls

3. **Video Streaming**
   - Optional webcam sharing
   - Screen sharing capability
   - Bandwidth optimization

### Phase 5: Advanced Features
**Goal:** Polish and performance optimization

1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Binary serialization tuning
   - Connection pooling
   - Bandwidth optimization

2. **Browser Compatibility**
   - WebSocket fallback for older browsers
   - Feature detection
   - Progressive enhancement

## Technology Decisions

### Transport Layer
- **Primary**: WebTransport (maximum performance for gaming)
- **Fallback**: WebSockets for older browsers (implement later if needed)
- **Development**: Self-signed certificates for local testing

### Serialization
- **Game Data**: Binary (bincode) for performance
- **Chat/UI**: JSON for simplicity
- **WebRTC**: Standard SDP/ICE formats

### Frontend Architecture
- **Keep**: Rust WASM + HTMX hybrid
- **Game Logic**: Pure WASM for performance
- **UI Updates**: HTMX for simplicity
- **Real-time**: Direct WebTransport from WASM for maximum performance

### Backend Architecture
- **Language**: Rust (consistent with frontend)
- **Framework**: Tokio + warp (async-first)
- **Database**: Start simple (in-memory), add persistence later
- **Deployment**: Railway (consistent with frontend)

## Questions to Resolve

1. **Game Type**: What kind of game should we build first?
   - Simple chat room with movement?
   - Basic multiplayer game (pong, snake)?
   - More complex game mechanics?

2. **Concurrency Model**: How many players per game room?
   - 2-8 players for testing?
   - Larger lobbies later?

3. **Persistence**: Do we need a database immediately?
   - Start with in-memory state?
   - Add Redis/PostgreSQL later?

4. **Authentication**: How do we identify players?
   - Anonymous with nicknames?
   - Simple token-based auth?
   - Full user accounts?

## Next Steps

1. **Decide on Phase 1 scope** - What's the minimal viable demo?
2. **Choose starter game mechanics** - What's fun but simple?
3. **Set up development workflow** - Local testing, deployment pipeline
4. **Create project structure** - Server repo, shared types

What do you think? Should we start with a simple chat room with player movement, or dive into a specific game mechanic?
